      <h3>Q: Tell us about your journey as an artisan. How did you get started in felt-making?</h3>
      <p>My journey began when I was a child, watching my grandmother create beautiful shyrdaks (traditional felt rugs) by hand. I was fascinated by how a simple material like wool could be transformed into something so intricate and meaningful. Over time, I began to learn from her, starting with small tasks and eventually developing my own style. Felt-making runs deep in my family, and it’s more than just a craft—it’s a way of preserving our culture and traditions.

      <h3>Q: What are some of the traditional techniques and materials used in felt-making?</h3>
      <p>The process is quite involved. First, we use wool from local sheep, which is cleaned and carded to prepare it for felting. Traditionally, the wool is wet-felted, where layers of wool are compressed and agitated with water and soap. One of the key techniques is ornament carving, where we layer different colors of felt and carve out traditional Kazakh patterns like koshkar muyiz (ram's horns), which symbolize strength and resilience. Everything is done by hand, with tools that have been passed down through generations.</p>

      <h3>Q: What is the cultural significance of felt-making in Kazakhstan?</h3>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges is the lack of appreciation for traditional crafts in today's fast-paced, mass-produced world. Many young people are more interested in modern, quick solutions and often overlook the value of something handmade. There’s also the challenge of sourcing materials; we aim to use natural, locally sourced wool, but it’s becoming harder to find as more sheep farms move toward synthetic alternatives. Finally, it’s tough competing with cheaper, machine-made products, but we stay true to our craft because we believe in its cultural and artistic value.

      <h3>Q: What are some of the challenges you face as a traditional artisan in the modern world?</h3>
      <p>I would say, start small and be patient. Traditional crafts like felt-making require time, practice, and a deep understanding of the history and meaning behind each technique. It’s not just about creating something beautiful; it’s about preserving a legacy. Also, don’t be afraid to combine tradition with modern creativity. There’s room for innovation while still honoring the roots of our culture. Most importantly, be proud of your heritage and carry it forward with care.
